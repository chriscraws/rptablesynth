Sorry there's not much in this right now. What will be done by the end of the week:

Main components (classes) :
- synthesizer
contains everything else and keeps time
- oscillator
outputs a single signal
- filter
has one input and one output
- envelope
controls one or more specified ‘controllables’
- mixer
Accepts N inputs and gives one output
Volume of inputs and the output are ‘controllables’
